# Week 1-Basic of music data
## Identify a theme
The topic of my dataset is Taylor Swift, a famous American singer. I chose her as my topic because I have always loved her songs and knowing more about her was more beneficial to me to complete this task.
Taylor Swift began songwriting at the age of 14 and became a country singer in 2005 when she signed with Big Machine Records. With more than 200 million records sold worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time, the most-played female artist on Spotify, and the only artist with five U.S. albums that have sold more than 1 million copies in their first week. She has released very popular albums such as "Fearless", "1989" and "Red".
## Types of data
### Musical Scores - Noted data
Sheet music for Taylor Swift songs can be found on sites such as MusicNotes, Sheet Music Plus and Sheet Music Direct, which not only allow you to search by artist, title, album, etc., but also to filter for different instruments on that basis.
### Metadata - Descriptive data
Taylor Swift has [her own website](https://www.taylorswift.com/) where you can get the latest information about her performances, album releases, etc., especially for tours like the recent ones, which are the first to be updated on the website.
Her songs are available on all major platforms, such as Apple Music, Spotify, and Youtube. On these platforms, users can find relevant descriptive data, such as tracks, album titles, lyrical content, song duration, producer list and copyright information.
At the same time, relying on the current big data, many music platforms can make song recommendations based on algorithms, user listening preferences, etc., like I am often pushed Taylor Swift's song list with other singers who have a similar style to her. This is precisely because of the many descriptive data stored in the background of these software, according to which the songs are classified, organized, compared and recommended for users to choose.
### Audio Recordings - Acoustic data
As I mentioned before, Taylor Swift's music can be found on Spotify, Apple Music , YouTube, and other major media service platforms. She has also released a number of physical albums of her music, all of which are available on her own website.
She also performs her songs at her own concerts or other music festivals, such as the recent The Eras Tour and the previous Coachella. Finally, we can also find fan covers, remixes, and other related videos on sites like YouTube.
## Challenges in the Future
I think there are several ways to discuss this. First, when it comes to music copyrights, although Taylor has been working to ensure the legality of music copyrights, some pirated music still occurs. It is possible that some listeners are acquiring pirated copies to listen to, and they still need to pay more attention to recognizing and reporting pirated music in their normal lives. Secondly, there may be a lot of information errors in different scores uploaded by people, and the scores and audio files can be organized and cleaned to ensure the consistency and usability of the data. Finally, music data may cover many languages and cultures, and need to deal with the differences between different languages and cultures. Some lyrics are fine in the original English environment, but ambiguities may arise after translation. Consideration needs to be given to the translation and interpretation of Taylor's songs in different countries and cultures to get a fuller understanding of what her lyrics are trying to convey and to avoid cultural differences.

# Week 2-Notation
## Identify a piece of music
This week I chose Taylor Swift's Blank Space from her "1989" album. This is a very popular song, and I also exported it as a [PDF version](https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/files/12765245/Blank.Space.Taylor.Swift.pdf).
An image of the transcript is attached below, alternatively, the transcript can be downloaded from [MuseScore](https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/blob/34adad8ff66699d520ea7c012faf52c36d22aa3a/Blank%20Space%20Taylor%20Swift.mscz).
