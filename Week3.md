# Week 3-Encoding Notated Music
## Task 1-Generating MusicXML and MEI files
Based on last week's task, I exported the transcribed composition from MuseScore to a MusicXML file, and then converted the MusicXML file to an MEI file.

-Download the MusicXML file [here](Blank.Space.Taylor.Swift.musicmxl).
-Download the MEI file [here](https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/blob/master/Blank%20Space%20Taylor%20Swift.mei).

## Task 2-Rendering the MEI file with Verovio
