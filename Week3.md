# Week 3-Encoding Notated Music
## Task 1-Generating MusicXML and MEI files
Based on last week's task, I exported the transcribed composition from MuseScore to a MusicXML file, and then converted the MusicXML file to an MEI file.

Download the MusicXML file [here](Blank.Space.Taylor.Swift.mxl).
Download the MEI file [here](Blank.Space.Taylor.Swift.mei).
