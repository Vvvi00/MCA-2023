<h2> Task 1: Generating a piano roll and a pitch histogram </h2>
	<table>
	<tr> 
	<td class="description"> <b> Pitch histogram </b> <br/> <br/>The extracted pitch histogram shows the number of times a particular note has been 
		played in a song. According to this histogram, the most common pitch in my piece is A3, 
		which is consistent with the data extracted from jSymbolic as MIDI pitch value of 57 is equivalent to A3. </td>
	<td class="image"><img id="Pitch" src="https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/assets/145675705/a5769933-5b0e-4df6-a214-b7e3a31009d7"> </td>
	</tr> 
	<tr>
	<td class="description"> <b> Piano Roll </b> <br/> <br/>The extracted piano roll, like any piano roll, shows the order, length, 
		and pitch of the notes played accross time. It seems to be consistent with the rest of analytical data from this page (as seen when comparing
		it with the historgram for example, since the commonality of notes presented in the histogram seems to correspond to the piano roll).  </td>
	<td class="image"><img id="histrogram" src="https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/assets/145675705/fff506ad-95b5-410f-be33-7c2c1a0ab82a"> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td class="description"> <b> Scatter Plot of Pitches </b> <br/> <br/> The extracted scatter plot of pitches plots pitch against note length. Again, this seems to be consistent
		with my song as, for example, according to the graph the semibreve notes present in a song are A and C# which is consistent with the actual song.
