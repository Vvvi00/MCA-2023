<h2> Task 1: Generating a piano roll and a pitch histogram </h2>
	<table>
	<tr> 
	<td class="description"> <b> Pitch histogram </b> <br/> <br/>The piano roll extracted exhibits the chronological arrangement, duration, and pitch of the played notes over time, typical of any piano roll. 
		Its coherence aligns with other analytical data on this page. This alignment is evident when juxtaposing it with the histogram, 
		where the prevalence of notes in the histogram corresponds to the representation in the piano roll. </td>
	<td class="image"><img id="Pitch" src="https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/assets/145675705/a5769933-5b0e-4df6-a214-b7e3a31009d7"> </td>
	</tr> 
	<tr>
	<td class="description"> <b> Piano Roll </b> <br/> <br/>The extracted pitch histogram shows how many times a specific note was played in the song. 
		According to this histogram, there is a clear pitch gap in my compositions, with more bass overall. </td>
	<td class="image"><img id="histrogram" src="https://github.com/Vvvi00/MCA-2023/assets/145675705/fff506ad-95b5-410f-be33-7c2c1a0ab82a"> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td class="description"> <b> Scatter Plot of Pitches </b> <br/> <br/> The extracted scatter plot of pitches plots pitch against note length. Again, this seems to be consistent
		with my song as, for example, according to the graph the semibreve notes present in a song are A and C# which is consistent with the actual song.
