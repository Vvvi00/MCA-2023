# Week 5 - Standards in Curation
## Task1-Create a metadata schema
My group has a selection of different musical pieces, from classical music to pop songs, so the metadata we choose is quite broad. Here are some of the metadata elements I've chosen to relate to my work:

- Title: The name of the work I selected
- Composer: The name of the person who created an original work.
- Arranger: The name of the person who arranged this version of the original work.
- Encoder: The name of the person who encoded the piece of music.
- Date: The date the encoded file was published.
- Publisher: The name of the person who published the file.
- Publisher Location: The geographical location where the file was published.
- Performance medium: The instrument on which music is played.
- Key: The key of the music.
- Rhythm: The tempo of the transcribed piece of music.

## Task2-Modify my MEI document
Here is my updated [MEI file](../../data/Blank_Space_Taylor_Swift_Week5.mei) for Week 5.
