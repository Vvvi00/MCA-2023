# Week 2-Notation
## Task 1-Identify a piece of music
 This week I chose Taylor Swift's Blank Space from her "1989" album. This is a very popular song, and I also exported it as a [PDF version](../../data/Blank_Space_Taylor_Swift.pdf).
 
 An image of the transcript is attached below, alternatively, the transcript can be downloaded from [MuseScore](../../data/Blank_Space_Taylor_Swift.mscz).

## Task 2-Discussion about OMR engine transcription
### Good points:
- The score is roughly accurate
- Can express tuplet notes and clefs very well

### Changes needed:
- Score information must be added (e.g. title, composer, etc.)
- The beat and many notes are not very accurate and need to be calibrated and modified one by one.
