# Week10 - Audio Similarity and Transcription
## Task 1-Similarity
For this task, I decided to reuse the tracks from last week's assignment. In addition to these tracks, I also used the tracks given in the Favorites folder assigned this week. In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 are classical, tracks 4-6 are rock, and tracks 7-9 are music of my own choosing. In terms of my tracks, track 7 is Cruel Summer, track 8 is Animals, and track 9 is Queencard. As the matrix shows, tracks 0-3 are very different from tracks 7-9, but tracks 4-6 show some similarities between rock and pop music, especially Cruel Summer-Taylor Swift, which can be seen as follows some elements of classical music are also incorporated in their music.
