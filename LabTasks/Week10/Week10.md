# Week10 - Audio Similarity and Transcription
## Task 1-Similarity
For this task, I decided to reuse the tracks from last week's assignment. In addition to these tracks, I also used the tracks given in the Favorites folder assigned this week. In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 are classical, tracks 4-6 are rock, and tracks 7-9 are music of my own choosing. In terms of my tracks, track 7 is Cruel Summer, track 8 is Animals, and track 9 is Queencard. As the matrix shows, tracks 0-3 are very different from tracks 7-9, but tracks 4-6 show some similarities between rock and pop music, especially Cruel Summer-Taylor Swift, which can be seen as follows some elements of classical music are also incorporated in their music.

The plot graph makes it clearer how similar Cruel Summer is to rock music, and how dissimilar my choice of music is to classical music. However, this graph is only based one the occurence of C's and A's

## Task 2-Transcription
For this task, I decided to transcribe the file I generated in week 2, Blank Space. This was done by first exporting the MuseScore file as a wav file, then importing it into Sonic Visualiser and converting it to a piano roll and exporting it as a MIDI file. MuseScore then opens the MIDI file and exports the PDF file.

### Compare the Transcription
The differences between the files are obvious, the score is a mess and the composition of the notes is completely different compared to the original. The first difference is that the automatically transcribed file has the entire song written as two staves, while the original file has one voice stave and two piano staves. Secondly, the original file has a falling pitch, while the transcribed file has a rising pitch, so the tones are different. But I also discovered that both versions are shot in 4/4. I don't think it's recommended to use automatic transcription without human supervision if you want to get the most accurate score possible.
